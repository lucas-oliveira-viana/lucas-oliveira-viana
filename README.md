### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Lucas Oliveira from Brazil (ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·). I've been working as Software Developer since 2018. I'm passionate about technology, innovation, AI and UI/UX.  
I've worked on many software projects such as insurance, digital banking, church management and geomarketing, 
always focusing on creating software with usability, performance and quality.  
I have professional experience in Java, JavaScript and C# programming languages, but currently my focus is on JavaScript client-side and its frameworks (Angular, Vue, React).
